## Analog Concepts

### Key Concepts:
1. **PLL Design**: Developing a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) to generate high-frequency, low-jitter clock signals.
2. **Jitter Reduction**: Minimizing variations in clock edges due to noise.
3. **Phase Noise Analysis**: Examining and mitigating phase noise for signal fidelity.

### Modules:
- **PLL Submodules**:
  - **Phase Detector**: Compares input and feedback clocks.
  - **Charge Pump**: Converts phase error into voltage.
  - **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)**: Produces variable frequency clocks.
  - **Loop Filter**: Reduces noise for PLL stability.
  - **Frequency Divider**: Adjusts feedback clock.
- **Jitter Measurement Module**: Captures clock signal variations.
- **Phase Noise Analyzer**: Analyzes noise characteristics.
